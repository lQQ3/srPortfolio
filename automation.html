						<strong>
							<p class="text-left">These are generations 1 and 2 of my robotic gardeners. The one in the black box is v.2 and run both my indoor and outdoor gardens, is organic, solar-powered, and is responsive to my Weather Station and Environmental Sensors. I have recently added Computer Vision for identifying soil composition and have begun to create Machine Learning training routines to predict future needs of the plants.</p>
							<p class="text-left">My rules have been simple: I am only allowed to put seeds in teh hydroponic unit, move them outside once large enough, hook up sensors and supply lines, and I can harvest. I may not touch the plants for any other reason. Pest control is entirely handled by biodiversity, plant vigor and feeding the local bird population to entice them to tend my garden. I am not using any fungicidal or insecticidal techniques.</p>
							<p class="text-left">Without introducing AI or Data Visualization, but only responding to immediate conditions, I have decreased my water and nutrient use by 27% and have increased yield and growth rates by 45% and 38% respectively. It has been running for a full year now and finally has enough data to begin forecasting, data visualization and the most exciting phase of computer learning. I expect that this will introduce further </p>
