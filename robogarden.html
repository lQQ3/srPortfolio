        <h2>Hello! My name is Shawn Rice. I have worked in all sectors of IT and am now a Data Scientist.</h2>
        <strong>
            <p>I've been a Systems Analyst for over 20 years and have recently graduated from Portland State University with a Data Science degree. I am an expert in the entire Microsoft stack; both MS365 as well as the Azure/AD/SharePoint stack. I code in many languages including Python, Javascript and C++. Also part of my expertise are SQL, Data Scraping, Data Cleaning, Data Transformations, Data Visualization, Data Forecasting, Systems Analysis, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reporting & Dashboards and Automated Testing.</p>
            <p>My interests and experience cover a wide range of computer and science skills, so I've arranged my portfolio to show my top three examples from each discipline. </p>
